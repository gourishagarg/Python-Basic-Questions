        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a computer language that people use to command computer.\n",
        "   - It is popular because of these reasons:\n",
        "       - Easy to learn.\n",
        "       - Lots of help available.\n",
        "       - Used Globally.\n",
        "       - Big Companies use it.\n",
        "       - Works on any computer.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    - The Python Interpreter helps your code run, like a helper that understand both you and the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "     - if, else, elif, for, while, break, continue, def, return, import, as, from, class, try, except, True/False, None, and,or,not, in, is, pass.\n",
        "     (There are around 35+ keywords but depends on Pytthon Verfsion.)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - NO,, keywords can not be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - It simply means whether a value can be changed after its created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are list mutable, but tuple are immutable?\n",
        "   - List are mutable because they are made to change- you can add, remove or update the items.\n",
        "   - Tuples are immutable because they are made to be fixed and unchangeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operations in Python?\n",
        "   - == : Checks if the values are equal. Even if they are two different objects, if the content is similar, == returns True.\n",
        "   - is : Checks if they are the same object. Returns True only if both points to the exactly same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - 1. and :\n",
        "      - Both objects must be same.\n",
        "   - 2. or :\n",
        "      - At least one object must be True.\n",
        "   - 3. not :\n",
        "      - Changes True to False, Flase to True.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting = changing the type of data\n",
        "   For example: string into int, int into float.\n",
        "   - Python makes it easy with functions like int(), str(), float(), and bool().\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "   - Implicit Type Casting : Python automatically converts one data type to another when needed. It happens without writting any extra code.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Explicit Type Casting : You have to write code to chnage the type. Use functionas likje : int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "   - Conditional statements are used to make decisions in your program. They help the program choose what to do based on certain conditions. They basically let your code make decisions and run only when certain things are True.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "   - For Example:\n",
        "      age = 15\n",
        "      if age >= 18:\n",
        "         print(\"Adult\")\n",
        "      elif age >= 13:\n",
        "         print(\"Teenager\")\n",
        "      else:\n",
        "         print(\"Child:)\n",
        "\n",
        "   so,\n",
        "   Python looks at the first if:\n",
        "   - Is age >= 18?\n",
        "   - NO (age is 15) -> So it skips this.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Then,\n",
        "   It checks the elif:\n",
        "   -Is age >= 13?\n",
        "   - Yes, (15 is more than 13) -> so it runs:\n",
        "                                print(\"Teenager\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  Then,\n",
        "  it stops checking after one condition is True. It does not run the else.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - In Python, for and while loops are used to repeat things.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A for loop is used when you know how much times to repeat. For exaple, for i in range (5) will run 5 times.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A while loop is used when you dont know how many times, but want to repeat until a condition is True. For exaple, while i < 5 will keep running until i become 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "  So, use for when th number is fixed, and while when it's not fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "   - Imagine you are building a program that asks a user to guess a secret number. You dont know how many guesses the uswe will need may be 2 tries, may be 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this case, a while loop is better, because it can keep running until the user guesses the right number.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   secret = 7\n",
        "   guess = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "   while guess != secret:\n",
        "        guess = int(input(\"Guess the number:\"))\n",
        "        print(\"Wrong, try again!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(\"You got it!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here, we use while because we dont know how many times the user will guess.\n",
        "  A for loop would not fit well because the number of guesses is not fixed.\n"
